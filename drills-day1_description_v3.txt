Speech input does not work  when the speaker inputs equations: 
- an equation can consist of parentheses  and variables called x,y,z.
- calculating them would change the computation, and the letter y can be misinterpreted as a question. 
- for formulas, use text based requests and voice requests only for plain-language queries.
